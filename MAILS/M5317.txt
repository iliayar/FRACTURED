FROM MALCOLM@FREEMAIL ------ TO SUSI@FRACTURED
SUBJECT: APPLICATION
GOOD EVENING MA'AM, MY NAME IS MALCOLM, 
MALCOLM SCHNEIDER. I SAW YOUR COMMERCIAL IN 
THE NEWSPAPER ABOUT BEING PART OF A CLINICAL STUDY. 
WHILE I DO NOT WANT TO BE PART OF THE STUDY, I WANTED 
TO ASK IF YOU ARE STILL LOOKING FOR EMPLOYEES. 
I HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH COMPUTERS AND I AM WORKING ON 
MY MASTERS RIGHT NOW. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A JOB, I WOULD 
ALSO BE GRATEFUL FOR A CHANCE ON AN INTERNSHIP. 
I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR REPLY, MALCOLM SCHNEIDER
