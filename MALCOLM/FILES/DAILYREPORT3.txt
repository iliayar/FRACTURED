1.8.1986: PACKAGING AGAIN - I AM 100% ON THE 
DESIGN TEAM. THIS TIME IT WAS MOSTLY
FOR MEDICATION AND SANITARY PRODUCTS.
A FEW GOOD ONES WERE THERE. I LIKE 
THE ONES WITH BRAIL. THEY ALLOW PEOPLE
TO READ WHAT THEY TAKE, EVEN IF THEY
ARE BLIND. I PICKED FAVOURITES THIS 
TIME AND THEY SAID THEY WILL 
GIVE ME THOSE FOR A CLOSER INSPECTION
TOMORROW. 
TILL THEN
