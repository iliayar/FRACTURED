FROM SUSI@FRACTURED ------ TO PETER@FRACTURED
SUBJECT: CHANGE YOUR PW!
HELLO PETER I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH OUR IT 
TEAM AND THEY KINDLY REQUEST THAT YOU FINALLY CHANGE 
YOUR PASSWORD. WE ALL KNOW HOW PROUD YOU ARE OF YOUR 
WATERBED, BUT WE CANNOT ALLOW YOU TO KEEP IT A THIRD 
TIME IN A ROW. 
CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD! 
REGARDS, SUSI
