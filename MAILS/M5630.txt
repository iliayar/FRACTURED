FROM HARRIS@FRACTURED ------ TO MAX@FRACTURED
SUBJECT: WELCOME TO THE TEAM
HEY MAX,
BARBARA JUST SEND ME A MAIL INFORMING ME
THAT YOU NOW ARE NOW STAGE FOUR. I THINK
THAT BARBARA ALREADY INFORMED YOU, BUT
I WANTED TO REMIND YOU: FAILURE IS NOT
AN OPTION, UNLESS YOU WANT TO SEE
YOURSELF IN ONE OF OUR SUBJECT PROGRAMS.
NOW, ONCE AGAIN I WELCOME YOU TO THE 
TEAM. KEEP AN EYE ON JOHN, AND REPORT
DAILY ON HIS BEHAVIOUR.
