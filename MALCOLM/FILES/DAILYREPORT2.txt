1.7.1986: SECOND DAY JUST OVER. HELLO ITS MALCOLM
AGAIN. TODAY WAS WEIRD. THEY ASKED ME
TO TAKE A LOOK AT A LOT OF PICTURES.
THEY ASKED ME TO RATE EACH AND EVERY
SINGLE ONE OF THEM AND IT WAS MOSTLY
PACKAGING. THEY HAD A FEW ODD ONES,
I ASSUME OUT OF STATE PRODUCTS? BUT
ALL IN ALL I WAS ASKED TO RATE PACKAGING
ON A SCALE OF 1-10. I GUESS THEY WANT
ME FOR THE DESIGN TEAM! 
TILL THEN
