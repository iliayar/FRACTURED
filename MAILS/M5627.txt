FROM HARRIS@FRACTURED ------ TO CLASS4@FRACTURED
SUBJECT: UPDATE
IT ASKED ME TO INFORM THE STAFF
THAT FOR SECURITY REASONS THE COLOR ON YOUR TERMINALS
HAS BEEN ADJUSTED. YOU MAY MANUALLY ADJUST THE COLOR
WITH THE SETENV TOOL. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS TOOL
IS VERY POWERFUL AND IT ASKED ME TO REMIND
EVERYONE TO ONLY CHANGE COLOR, BUT TO NOT CHANGE ANY SPEED
AS THIS CAN RESULT IN CORRUPTION. THEY ALSO
WANT ME TO REMIND EVERYONE
TO USE THIS TOOL TO DEFRAGMENT OUR
NEW MODIFIED TERMINALS ON A REGULAR BASIS.
