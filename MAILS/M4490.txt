FROM PAUL@FRACTURED ------ TO SUSI@FRACTURED
SUBJECT: LOUD HUMMING OF COMPUTER FAN
HEY SUSI, HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY? I HOPE YOU 
ARE DOING FINE. I KNOW YOU ARE VERY BUSY TODAY 
BUT I NOTICED SOMETHING IN REGARDS TO OUR 
COMPUTERS. THE FAN, IT IS REALLY LOUD AND 
DISTRACTING. CAN YOU ASK IT IF WE COULD HAVE THEM 
EXCHANGED? 
KIND REGARDS, PAUL 
PS: SEE YOU ON FRIDAY AT HENRY'S FIRST ROUND ON ME!
